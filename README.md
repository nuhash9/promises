# Promises

An app to keep track of the promises you make or agree to.

Promises are the foundation of banking and the corporate world. Or any exchange of goods, or services. But it seems to be too abstract on the individual scale.

What if it was gamified? Would it help or hinder our own well-being and the flourishing of our social relationships? This is a way to find out. Or at least showcase some cool tech in the process of making it 🙌🏽
